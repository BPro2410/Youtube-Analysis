# Youtube-Analysis
Scraps information about latest yt videos

This class can be used to download information from various youtube channels using selenium for web scraping purposes. This code only works for german users because of the different html youtube popup window when entering the platform. If you are based in any other country than Germany and want to scrap yt information you might have to change code lines 39-41 first.

All you need to do to initialise the class is to enter the name of the Youtuber for which you want to retrieve information.
This class provides you with information about:
- Video title
- Views
- Upload date
- Visual analytics of click development


One example of analysing different youtube channels can be seen below.
